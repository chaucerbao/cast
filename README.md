# Cast

Have you ever been excited to start a brand new project, then brought over tools and their extensions and configuration files from older projects, and audit them line-by-line to see what's still relevant. An hour in, and you haven't even started coding yet.

Stop it.

Cast will allow you to deploy preset tool combinations and their configuration files.
